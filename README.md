## Purpose

The Hackathon groups were each tasked with the challenge of developing a product aimed at providing disaster relief for socially impacted areas of our global economy, i.e. climate change, mental health, equal opportunities, and etcetera, within 48 hours.

Using React, React-router-DOM, React-Icons, Functional Approach Only, Hooks, Context, Styled Components, Figma and Miro as the foundation for which the UI lies upon, we have been able to merge both the Front with the Back through deployment and API calls.
